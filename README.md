# SimplX

## Code education. 
... It may mean a variety of things to many people but to us it means educating budding engineers and software developers in the intricacies of coaxing a modern compiler to solve our problems. That means learning syntaxes and the method of writing code for modern day compilers and programming languages.

Nowadays a lot of **people are at no loss for ideas or goals** for projects, ***but*** are yet **limited by either their inability to code or an inability to code efficiently** and this puts them at a large disadvantage in this industry and age. 

## Our solution 
Simplx is an Android app, where anyone can learn how to code, and quickly generate large segments of code with just their voice, a phone and a little bit of logic.

## Two-fold functionalities.

* **Spoken Logic (NLP) to Code**

The Application shall be capable of converting **spoken logic** into **efficient and simple code** in a **programming language of *your choice***. Natural Language Processing is used to identify key parts of the phrases and expressions and in turn convert them to syntactical correct code.

* **Flowchart to Code**

Our application shall also be capable of **visualizing logic from flow charts** and **convert the same to code** using the above conversion engine. The flow chart is broken down into parts and is processed to generate code in again a programming language of *your choice*.

## Use Cases
* Can be used to map logic to variety of programming languages. 
* Students and beginners can use it for learning code.
* On a higher levels, developers can use it to generate small-scale modules of large-scale projects in little time.
